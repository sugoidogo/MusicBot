# JMusicBot-bypass

**This is a fork of JMusicBot**, created to reverse unwanted changes first introduced in [upstream pull request #1486](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/pull/1486). This PR, which was first included in release version 0.4.0, makes the bot completely exit if it's run in an "unsupported manner", namely on a public or verified bot. This can cause many problems, especially if the bot is set to auto start in a systemd service, since default behavior will cause systemd to automatically restart it endlessly, causing the bot to contact the Discord API thousands of times in a short time period, further causing Discord to reset the bot token due to potential abuse.

With this fork, instead of completely exiting the bot, it just throws an error, letting the user know that the behavior their bot is running under is unsupported, and that they shouldn't report bugs caused by said unsupported behavior. I believe the user should be free to run the bot however they like, even in the **unlikely** event that it might introduce undesired behavior.

The only changes made in this fork are to modify the changes made in the aforementioned PR, and to redirect update checks and relevant URLs to this repository. I aim to keep this fork up to date with the latest upstream release. If at least 24 hours have passed since the latest upstream release and this fork hasn't been updated accordingly, please notify me by opening an issue in this fork or contacting me otherwise.

## Questions/Suggestions/Bug Reports
**Please read the [Issues List](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/issues) before suggesting a feature**. If you have a question, need troubleshooting help, or want to brainstorm a new feature, please start a [Discussion](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/discussions). If you'd like to suggest a feature or report a reproducible bug, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/issues) on this repository. If you like this bot, be sure to add a star to the libraries that make this possible: [**JDA**](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and [**lavaplayer**](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer)!

## Editing
This bot (and the source code here) might not be easy to edit for inexperienced programmers. The main purpose of having the source public is to show the capabilities of the libraries, to allow others to understand how the bot works, and to allow those knowledgeable about java, JDA, and Discord bot development to contribute. There are many requirements and dependencies required to edit and compile it, and there will not be support provided for people looking to make changes on their own. Instead, consider making a feature request (see the above section). If you choose to make edits, please do so in accordance with the Apache 2.0 License.
